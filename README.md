# Lucene-Librarian

Meet Lucilla, an attempt of mine to understand how Apace Lucene works.
Lucilla is command line search Application, that can index your directory contents for you 
and then help you find them.

Lucilla is based on Java and needs to be executed through the JRE. 
So, if you want to try the application out, download the SearchApplication.java file and place it into one of your directories.

Once done that run the file. It will index your files and therefore make them retrievable as search terms.
(It will only index the file titles)

Of course you will need to change the paths in the Java file, if you want it to work.
It is also recommended, that you get the pom.xml file in case of dependency problems and run Maven on it.

### Have fun with the thing!
